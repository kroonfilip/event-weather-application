## General info
This React App is developed by three students as a part of the university course *Multi-platform applications with web technologies* 

## Project
We have developed an event and weather application. With the help of this website a user can enter a date and a city and the application will return a weather forcast for that specific date and a list of the planned events on that same day. The user can receive up to 20 events. Users can save events which are then added to a favorites list.

## API
This website uses external APIs from:

* https://openweathermap.org/api

* https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/

## Technology
This project is created with:
* React version: 18.1.0
* W3.CSS version 4

## Arguments for React
* **Learning curve** 
    * It is considered to have a lower learning curve than, for example, Angular.
* **Size** 
    * We have chosen to use the React framework as we considered this to be a suitable framework for an application of this size.
* **Job opportunities** 
    * According to our assessments, React is a very common framework used by many companies right now. Experience with React is often requested in job advertisements.
    * According to Google trends, it is confirmed that there is a great deal of interest in React in the labor market.
    * [Google Trends] (https://trends.google.com/trends/embed/explore/TIMESERIES?req=%7B%22comparisonItem%22%3A%5B%7B%22keyword%22%3A%22Vue%20jobs%22%2C%22geo%22%3A%22%22%2C%22time%22%3A%22today%2012-m%22%7D%2C%7B%22keyword%22%3A%22React%20jobs%22%2C%22geo%22%3A%22%22%2C%22time%22%3A%22today%2012-m%22%7D%2C%7B%22keyword%22%3A%22Angular%20jobs%22%2C%22geo%22%3A%22%22%2C%22time%22%3A%22today%2012-m%22%7D%5D%2C%22category%22%3A31%2C%22property%22%3A%22%22%7D&tz=-120&eq=cat%3D31%26q%3DVue%2520jobs%2CReact%2520jobs%2CAngular%2520jobs%26date%3Dtoday%2012-m%2Ctoday%2012-m%2Ctoday%2012-m)

* **Community**
    * Large active community that contributes to its development.
    * With Facebook behind it and several other major influential companies using it, there is probably strong support for the framework in the foreseeable future. This means that we can expect stability and that new versions will be released regularly.

## Other possible frameworks
* **Angular**
    * Opted out due to a higher learning curve and that it is considered more suitable for larger business applications.
* **Vue**
    * Vue could be an alternative as it is a small and fast framework, but React's extensive support, flexibility and in-demand knowledge of the labor market outweighs and in this case it is the decisive argument.
